Maze Game/Map Creator.
Utilized various programming techniques such as methods, arrays, OOP, and a GUI to develop a visual map creator allowing users to save, load, and play their own designs on a game panel.

Users can create their own map with the Map Creator. Use the tools on the side to fill in spaces with blocks. Money is needed in order to pass the ATM machines, and a key is required to step on the purple stone which indicates the end of the game.

Once you are done creating your map, use the SAVE function and save the map as a .txt file. 

Open the Game Panel and use the OPEN function to open your previously saved map. Press PLAY to start playing. The heart player can move using the WASD keys. 

If you were able to step on the purple stone and finish, a window saying "YOU WIN" will pop up.
